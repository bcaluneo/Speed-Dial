### Speed Dial

A visual bookmark added for Firefox reminiscent of old T9 speed dial setups.

##### Development Requirements:

1. Clock
2. 9 editable cells
  - The limit of 9 is kept for design purposes so as not to clutter the screen. This may change.
  - Each cell can have its URL and title modified.
  - Each cell should fetch an image of the website when the dial is modified. If not a repository of common site images should be fetched.
3. Smaller "tool" links below the clock.
  - These are sites that are frequently used but not enough to be one of the main 9 cells.
  - These should have the ability to be created as well as being edited.

##### Design Requirements:
